# Bug Fixes and Consistency Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. **Import Management**
- Moved all imports to the top of the file for better organization
- Added proper import guards for optional dependencies (numpy, PIL, websocket, requests)
- Removed duplicate import statements throughout the codebase
- Added graceful error messages when optional dependencies are missing

### 2. **Dependency Handling**
- Updated `requirements.txt` to include all necessary dependencies:
  - numpy>=1.21.0 (for image analysis)
  - websocket-client>=1.3.0 (for live preview)
  - psutil>=5.9.0 (for performance monitoring)
- Added import guards that check if modules are available before use
- Functions return helpful error messages if required dependencies are missing

### 3. **Version Consistency**
- Updated all version references to 2.4.0:
  - FastMCP server version
  - get_server_info response
  - get_performance_metrics response
- Updated total tool count from 63 to 73 in get_server_info

### 4. **Code Fixes**
- Fixed `json_lib` references to use standard `json` module
- Removed duplicate `import requests` statements (18 occurrences)
- Removed duplicate `from PIL import Image` statements (7 occurrences)
- Added proper error handling for missing dependencies
- Fixed conditional_workflow to not rely on non-existent methods
- Implemented proper get_generation_status function (was placeholder)
- Added global `startup_time` variable for performance metrics

### 5. **Error Handling Improvements**
- Consistent error return format: `{"error": str(e)}`
- Added dependency checks before using optional modules
- Better error messages that suggest installation commands

### 6. **Testing**
- Created `test_basic.py` for core functionality testing
- Created `test_advanced.py` for new v2.4.0 features
- All tests pass successfully when dependencies are installed

## Installation Commands

To ensure all features work properly:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source mcp_venv/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install individually if needed:
pip install numpy websocket-client psutil
```

## Verified Functionality

✅ Core MCP server operations
✅ Health checks and system stats
✅ Model listing and discovery
✅ Conditional workflows
✅ Output organization
✅ Semantic search
✅ Image composition analysis
✅ Live preview streaming
✅ Metadata extraction
✅ Performance monitoring

## Known Limitations

1. Some placeholder implementations remain for complex features requiring specific ComfyUI nodes:
   - Face restoration
   - Background removal
   - Some video generation features
   
2. These would require specific custom nodes to be installed in ComfyUI

## Recommendations

1. Always run in a virtual environment
2. Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
3. Ensure ComfyUI is running before using the MCP server
4. Check logs for any import warnings on startup
